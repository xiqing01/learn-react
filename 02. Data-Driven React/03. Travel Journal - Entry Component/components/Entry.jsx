/**
 * Challenge: Build out the Entry component and render 1 instance of it
 * to the App
 * 
 * For now, just hard-code in the data, which you can find in
 * japan.md so you don't have to type it all out manually :)
 * 
 * Notes:
 * – Only render 1 instance of this Entry component for now
 * – I've pulled in marker.png for the little map marker icon
 *   that goes next to the location name
 * – The main purpose of this challenge is to show you where our limitations
 *   currently are, so don't worry about the fact that you're hard-coding all
 *   this data into the component.
